	<p>According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009â€“2010, it is estimated there are 77.5 million people with pet dogs in the United States.Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This influence on human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. And of course, dogs are very friendly.</p>
